# startWorkflowHook
A generic hook that you can use to start an EIP from an Experience Card or Page

There are two files here, the hook itself and an example page to show you how to use the hook. The hook is very basic right now, but all you have to do is pass the workflow ID when you first create the hook.

You'll need to provide the workflow ID to run it. Here are some screenshots showing how you can find it.
